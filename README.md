## Introduction 
Have you ever been to a new city or region and thought, "Where can I get a drink around here?" With BrewFind you can:

-Find the breweries/bottleshops/cideries near your location.

-Search by region to plan your stops for your next trip.

-Search by venues that are dog-friendly, have a patio, or other accomodations you may need.

-Sort by how large the business is; from microbreweries up to large breweries.

Also you can keep a log of which breweries you have visited so you can tell other people about your favorites.
